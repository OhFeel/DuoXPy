# Feature 

- XP farm ‚ö°Ô∏è
- Streak keeper üî•

# Usage 

  0. Download from Releases    
  1. Go to [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com) and log in to your Duolingo account
  2. Open the browser's console by pressing `F12` button ( or `Fn+F12` on some laptops )
  3. Click on the tab `Console` then paste this to the console

```
document.cookie
  .split(';')
  .find(cookie => cookie.includes('jwt_token'))
  .split('=')[1]
```
  4. Copy the token without `'` ( example: 'abcde1234` -> abcde1234 )
  5. Open CMD, run `pip install requests` or `pip3 install requests`
  6. Click and run `DuoXPy.py` or using `python` or `python3` command
  7. Follow instructions	

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Usually, if you enter a lot of lessons ( like >1000 ) or if Duolingo cannot handle the request, you will receive an error code or log, and the lesson will be skipped. So, think wisely before entering the lesson!
> 
> If you got `No skillId found in xpGains` log then try to do least 1 lesson so it can run back to normal!

## How to fix `Error 500 - No SkillID found in xpGains`?

- Do not let your latest study session empty, at least get them to level 1 like these images below by completing 1 lesson or some lessons ( applied for every single course like English, Spanish, Japanese, etc... )
